#  App Store
### App Store has been built to *mimic* or *clone* the design of the iOS 11+ App Store app.

The entire app works but is not yet finished, some work needs to be done on transitions before I'll upload them implemented.


Please be aware, this is based on the Swift version found [here](https://github.com/phillfarrugia/appstore-clone), I've just converted everything to Objective-C (minus some classes) in an entirely new app (all files are my own, with added improvements, starting from scratch).
